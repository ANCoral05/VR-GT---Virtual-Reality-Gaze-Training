# GazeQuest - A Virtual Reality Framework for Rehabilitation, Simulation, and Research of Visual Field Defects (work in progress)

## Overview

The GazeQuest is a Virtual Reality based application designed for rehabilitation and experimental evaluation of visual field defects, in particular those caused by Retinitis pigmentosa. The software incorporates three visual tasks in virtual scenes that are designed to test and improve the visual performance of people living with peripheral visual field defects (tunnel vision). Further, the software includes the option to artificially simulate tunnel vision, allowing people with healthy visual field to experience the effects of these visual impairments in different virtual tasks. Note that this simulation feature is only available in Virtual Reality devices with integrated eye tracking capabilities, such as the Pico Neo 2 Eye or the HTC VIVE Pro Eye.

### Clinical Trial

The software has been experimentally tested and evaluated in a clinical trial, retrospectively approved by the German Registry of Clinical Trials (DRKS) under the ID DRKS00032628 [(link)](https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00032628). Results of the clinical trial are reported in the second publication listed above.
